Inside the house lived a malevolent phantom. People said he existed, but Jem and I had
never seen him. People said he went out at night when the moon was down, and peeped in
windows. When people’s azaleas froze in a cold snap, it was because he had breathed on
them. Any stealthy small crimes committed in Maycomb were his work. Once the town was
terrorized by a series of morbid nocturnal events: people’s chickens and household pets
were found mutilated; although the culprit was Crazy Addie, who eventually drowned
himself in Barker’s Eddy, people still looked at the Radley Place, unwilling to discard their
initial suspicions. A Negro would not pass the Radley Place at night, he would cut across to
the sidewalk opposite and whistle as he walked. The Maycomb school grounds adjoined the
back of the Radley lot; from the Radley chickenyard tall pecan trees shook their fruit into
the schoolyard, but the nuts lay untouched by the children: Radley pecans would kill you. A
baseball hit into the Radley yard was a lost ball and no questions asked.
